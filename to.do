(Add checkboxes for options like "-p" where there are no args)

(Have a drop down menu system like windows explorer for selecting
 down through the available codebase dirs, systems, and modules
 and scripts)

(Then invoke the command and run in the window, or use the
 special graphical manager dialog, and capture input and output)

(Put dashboard in the path)

(Display the code comments for the different modules in a
 description section for each script)

(For scripts that use shift or ARGV[0] instead of BOSS::Config or
 the like, display them in the drop down menu but grey them, or
 have a terminal launch option)

(Have man pages and other documentation automatically generated
 and included here)

(put a nice splash screen or image, probably using website as
 design guide)

(add a custom thing for out Manager::UI or whatever system)

(if the codebase has an image, put it on the spec file)

(
 set an environment variable which decides whether you want
 commands to launch from GUI or CLI.  if args are passed with
 FRDCSA_DASHBOARD eq "enabled", set them as the defaults
 )

(Have custom panel interfaces for UniLang and it's agents, for
 QUAC, for PSE, for SPSE, etc)

(Work on the usability of the entire system)

(Possibly have it figure out the logic of different selections)

(Aim to have it monitor the system very well and provide a nice
 integrated overview)

(specifically develop the setanta-agent components for the
 Wednesday demo)

(figure out how to have it display properly either remotely or
 what)

(custom interfaces
 (SPSE/PSE)
 (write an interface for Clear for reading/visualizing texts)
 (UniLang)
 )
